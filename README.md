# Milestone Map

(C) Andrew Pritchard 2018

Milestone Map is a programme reporting tool that shows the progress of multiple programmes and projects based on key milestones.

It allows programme and delivery managers to view the overall status of programmes and projects within the context of associated "organisational milestones".

Please note that this is not a project management tool but rather a programme reporting tool.

For help on using the tool itself, please visit [the help file](docs/instructions.md).

Key features: 
- Able to show the health of individual milestones

Clone this repository. Open `src/index.html` for a debug build. A prebuilt copy of the latest stable release will be available at `docs/index.html`. 

## Build from source

You will need to install `npm` to build milestoneMap from source. Alternatively, MilestoneMap works without compilation if you open `src/index.html`.

After you have installed npm, navigate to the source directory and run:
