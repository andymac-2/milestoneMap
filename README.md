# Milestione Map

(C) Andrew Pritchard 2018

Milestone Map is a programme reporting tool to show the progress of multiple programmes and projects based on the key milestones.

It allows programme and delivery managers to get a view of the overall status of programmes and projects and in the context of associated "organisational milestones".

This is not a project management tool, rather a programme reporting tool.

For help using the actual tool itself, visit [the help file](docs/instructions.md)

Key features: Able to show the health of individual milestones.
