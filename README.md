# Milestone Map

(C) Andrew Pritchard 2018

Milestone Map is a program reporting tool that displays the progress of multiple programmes and projects based on key milestones.

Milestone Map allows program and delivery managers to view the overall status of programs and projects within the context of associated "organisational milestones".

# Note
Milestone Map is not a project management tool but a program reporting tool.

For help on using the tool, please visit [the help file](docs/instructions.md).

Key feature:
